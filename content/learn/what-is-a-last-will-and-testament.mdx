A last will and testament is a legal document that outlines how a person’s assets
should be distributed after their death.

## What a Will Can Do

A will allows you to name beneficiaries, appoint guardians for minor children,
and designate an executor to manage your estate.

## What a Will Cannot Do

Certain assets pass outside of a will, and a will does not avoid probate.
